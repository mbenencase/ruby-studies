# Ruby Studies

This repository contains simple scripts that were written by my own to understand and learn Ruby language. Further I intend to use Rails for Web development as the backend language.

# Dockerfile

I created a simple Dockerfile to run the most recent version of Ruby, that is 2.7.

First build the docker as follows:

```
docker build-t ruby:dev .
```

Then use `bash run.sh` to execute the Docker.
